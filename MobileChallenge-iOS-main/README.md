# MobileChallenge

This repository contains a Template Project for iOS Mobile Challenge. It provides the basic integration with [Apollo-iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) library and the API for the challenge. So that you can spend time on showing your code skills instead of puzzling out how to do this integration. 

We hope you will have fun working with GraphQL if that's your first time! Good luck ðŸ’ª
